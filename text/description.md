This is a Clamav installer that will allow you to update the clamav database and launch scans for the full Node. 
Simply select *Freshclam* in the Buttons once installed to updat the recognition DB.
And *Scan Now* to launch a full Scan of the Node.

**Note:** 
* The Scan will directly remove all infected Files. Even if False-Positive!
* The Scan will severely load your node and it might be slow to respond during the scan.
* There is *NO* automatic Scanning. Only when you utilise the *Scan Now* Button.
