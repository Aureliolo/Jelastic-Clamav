This is a Clamav installer that will allow you to update the clamav database and launch scans. 
Simply select **Scan Now** on the Addon once to get the options for scanning.

**Note:** 
* DO NO use expert mode if you are not sure on what you are doing!
* The Scan will severely load your node and it might be slow to respond during the scan or even be unresponsive.
* There is **NO** automatic Scanning. Only when you utilise the **Scan Now** Button is anything done.
* The Node needs at least 12 reserved Cloudlets to have enough RAM available for Clamav.
* If full node Scan is used, make sure the nothing is mounted which should not be scanned.
